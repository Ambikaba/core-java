1)java is a object oriented programming language. 
  javac is used to compile the java code.

2)java development kit(jdk) it contains java runtime environment(jre) and java tools.
  java runtime environment(jre) it contains jvm and libraries.
  java virtual machine(jvm) it converts source code into byte code.

3)java file contains the java code and is used to compile.
  .class file is the executable file.

5)variable is used to store the information. variables are of two types static variables and non static vatiables.
  static is a keyword which is used to store the constant variables
  non-static variables are not static it can be changed.
  ex:static int age-static
     string name - non static.

4)jdk,jvm,jre.

6)java is a object oriented programming because we can use objects to accesss the variables and methods in java.

7)compilation error.

8)data type is a what type of data is used to access the members of the class.
 they are two types of data types they are:-primitive and non-primitive
 a)primitive types are the default data types given by the java. ex:byte,short,int,long float,char,boolean,longint. 
 b)non primitive data types are used as the class names.ex:string,arrays,time etc.

9)dot operator is a operator which is used to access the variables and methods.
  ex:class Student
    {
       string name;
       
     student()
    {
       this.name=name;
       System.out.println("name is:" +name);
     }
   }

10)java features are:-
   *java is a object oriented programming language.
   *java is a platform independent language.
   *easy to learn.
   *java can be write once and run anywhere.
   *java is portable.

11)array is a homogeneous collection of elements is called array.
  ex: class Employee
     {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {

       int arr[]={1,2,3,4,6,9};
       for(int i=0;i<=5;i++)
      {
         System.out.println(arr[i]);
      }
     }
   }

12)class:-class is a keyword and it is a collection of elements.
   object:-object is a instance of a class.
ex: class Student
   {
     int age;
     String name;

   void displayinfo()
{
    this.name=name;
    this.age=age;
    System.out.println("name and age are :" +name+","+age);
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
  Student s = new Student();
  s.name();
  s.age();
  s.displayinfo();
}

}

13)keywords are the reserved words and thay have  predefined meaning.
  keywords are:- goto,if,static,while,for,super,else,new,do-while,boolean,absert,continue.

14)constructor is a special method  and it does not contain any return type,same name as that of the class name.
they are two types of constructor:-a)default constructor b)parametrised constructor
 a)default constructor:-the java will provide the default constructor.
 b)parametrised constructor:-when we are writing the program we can create a constructor and pass the parameters as a argument.

15)the main method is static because it can not be changed and it is a fixed method and the main method is mandatory to execute the program.
 types are:-a)static method and b)non static method
 a)static method:-static method is used to access the methods without changing, static is a keyword.
   syntax:-keyword returntype methodname(parameters)
  {
     method body.

  }
 b)non static method:-it does not contain any static keywords and it can be changed
   syntax:- returntype methodname(parameters)
  {
     method body.

  }

16)class Employee
   {
     public static void main(String[] args)
      int array[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
      
    for(int num=0;num<=5;num++)
   {
      System.out.println(array.length[num]);
   }
  }

17)method:-it is a block of code which is executed when it is called is called as method.
   method overloading:- method overloading is a same name as that of the class name but different parameters is called as method overloading.
  ex:-class Bag
     {
       String brand;
       String color;
      
    void display(String brand)
  {
      System.out.println("brand is : "+brand); 
      
  }
   
   void display(String brand,String color)
  {
      System.out.println("brand and color is : "+brand+","+color); 
      
  }


  public static void main(String[] agrs)
{
   System.out.println("main method started");
   bag.display("cotton");
   bag.display("cotton","blue");
}

}
